Sensititivity calculations from CTA Prod-1 from K. Bernloehr, in
old-style CTA format (pre-calculated background rates)

Columns:

log(E) Area   r68  r80  ERes. BG Rate  Diff Sens

---------------------------------------------
Notes 
 1) log(E) = log10(E/TeV) - bin centre
 2) Eff Area   - in square metres after all cuts
3) Ang. Res - 68% containment radius of gamma-ray PSF post cuts - in degrees 
4) Ang. Res - 80% containment radius of gamma-ray PSF post cuts - in degrees 
5) Fractional Energy Resolution (rms)
6) BG Rate  - inside point-source selection region - post call cuts - in Hz 
7) Diff Sens - differential sensitivity for this bin expressed as E^2 dN/dE 
 - in erg cm^-2 s^-1 - for a 50 hours exposure - 5 sigma significance including 
 systematics and statistics and at least 10 photons.
